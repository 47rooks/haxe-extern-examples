# Haxe extern examples and experiments

The base platform for this repo is Windows at the moment. I'm not averse to
having Linux, Mac code in here I just don't have those platforms readily 
available.

cpp externs are in the `cpp/` folder. They are generally built in Visual
Studio 2022, and will have both a lib (DLL) project and a test project in the
one solution.

These will then be wrapped by a Haxe class or classes and a Visual Studio Code
project.

## Projects

Under this directory there is a directory per target for which examples have
been created. The plan is to cover at least examples for cpp, hl and perhaps js.
There is no great plan to cover all possible types and structures but rather
to provide a representative sample and document techniques so that as cases
come up is it easy to write code to handle them.

## VSCode Configuration Notes

These notes are basically about configuring VSCode `launch.json` and
`tasks.json` for debugging Haxe and externs. In general you cannot run a
single debugger and move from the Haxe level to the c++ level seamlessly. But
you can configure a Haxe level debugger like hxcpp-debugger to work at the
Haxe level and the VSCode native debugger to handle debugging in c++. As your
Haxe program targetting cpp will compile to c++ if you know which location
in the c++ you need to start from this can be all you need.

This assumes that you have the VSCode Haxe Extension Pack extension installed.
You will also need the hxcpp-debugger and hxcpp-debug-server libraries.

Example launch.json
```
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Run hxcpp",
        "type": "hxcpp",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/export/cpp/Main-debug.exe"
      },
      {
        "name": "Dbg hxcpp",
        "type": "hxcpp",
        "request": "launch",
        "preLaunchTask": "Run-debugee",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/export/cpp/Main-debug.exe"
      },
      {
          "name": "Dbg VSC",
          "type": "cppvsdbg",
          "request": "launch",
          "program": "${workspaceFolder}/export/cpp/Main-debug.exe",
          "args": [],
          "stopAtEntry": false,
          "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
          "environment": [],
          "console": "externalTerminal",
          "symbolOptions": {
            "searchPaths": [
              "${workspaceFolder}/export/cpp",
              "${workspaceFolder}/extlib/cpp/mylib/x64/Debug"
            ],
            "searchMicrosoftSymbolServer": false
          }
      }
    ]
}
```

The `Run hxcpp` configuration is just to run the debug exe. The presumption
is that you have already built it the exe.

The `Debug hxcpp` runs the hxcpp debugger to debug cpp target code at the 
Haxe level. The significant fields are

```
name: this is the name that appears in the Run and Debug pulldown menu.
type: must be cppvsdbg for the internal native debugger.
program: the particular program you are debugging.
args: any args it must be launched with.
cwd: because of the way windows finds DLLs it can help to copy them into the 
directory containing the exe and then run it from there. Hence setting cwd to
this value is useful.
symbolOptions: needed to find the debugging symbols.
searchPaths: this should be set to a list of directories that contain pdb
files. In the example here that is, and the external library, respectively.
```

With these configurations in place VSCode Run-> Start Debugging can work with
either a Haxe hxcpp debugger or directly in c++ with the native debugger. You
just select the launch configuration in the Run and Debug pull down menu in
the debug view.
